# Volta Code Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to demonstrate your skills, with a tool of your choice, taking data and turning it into something meaningful.

## Problem
We have a publicly available endpoint, documented here: http://docs.voltaapi.com/api/#get--stations. Build an interface that exposes this data in whatever form you like.

### Requirements
Don't spend too much time on this, focusing on one feature is a plus
Deliver a product that is easy for us to consume
Commit history showing your thought/development process is always interesting
If you have any questions do not hesitate to reach out via email or phone. In consideration of your schedule, take as long as you need to return the challenge.

### Some examples/ideas for inspiration:
Display the stations on a map
Render a searchable table of the stations
Aggregate data about the stations and display a high-level metric

## Tips and Tricks
We don't spend much time reinventing wheels here at Volta. Depending on the meaning you would like to derive from our data, find a tool or library that helps you express it without writing an excessive amount of code or re-implementing existing technology.

Conversely, if you already have a tool or library in mind: show off your skills by using something you know when to provide new insight into our data. Engineering hours are expensive so we like to find a middle-ground between correctness and efficiency.
